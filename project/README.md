# Final Project

The submission instructions for the final project are easy.

Your final project is due Thursday, May 3rd. Please submit your final writeup as a file called `project.doc` or `project.pdf`, with any accompanying code in your repository. If you are using Jupyter Notebook, you can submit a notebook called `project.ipynb`.

In addition to writing up your choice of analysis and any observations/conclusions you draw from your analysis, your writeup should also include:

1. Your partner's name and Purdue username (if you have a partner). Only one partner needs to submit.

2. A section listing and describing the various source files you used. Explain what the contents of the file are (e.g., if you wrote a file that builds a linear regression model of your input data set, tell us that.)
