3) As k is increased, the shape of the histogram becomes more consistent and starts closely resembling the shape of the histogram with the entire data. In other words, the histogram becomes more accurate as k increases. 
If I regenerate the histograms, the shapes are slightly different. The shape remains more consistent for higher value of k.
prob1_plots/part3 directory contains all relevant plots for this part.

5) The mean of these sample means is 75.06991. This also falls in the bin with maximum frequency, which covers the range 75-76. It is also normal to expect this mean of sample means to be close to the actual mean of the entire data set.
Not surprisingly, this is close to the actual mean of the entire data set, which is 75.06305.
The means of the samples are normally distributed around the actual mean of the entire data set. The distribution seems slightly left-skewed because the actual mean is very close to the left border of the bin it belongs to. 
The variance decreases if the number of sample means is increased from 1000 to 10000 because more samples paint a more realistic picture. With 10000 samples, the mean of sample means (75.06841600000001) comes just a little closer to the actual mean.
The relevant plots can be found in the prob1_plots directory.
