What is interesting:
The distribution of the sample means corresponds to the distribution of the data itself. 
The first distribution of sample means looks laplacian.
The second distribution of sample means looks exponential.
The third distribution of sample means looks normal.

Plot A:
Mean of sample means = -0.0068983397  Actual mean =  -0.0108726418528
Plot B:
Mean of sample means = 3.0241220306  Actual mean =  2.935530171
Plot C:
Mean of sample means = 4.9185361  Actual mean =  4.97979685

The mean of the sample means of each data set is close to the actual mean of the entire data set.
